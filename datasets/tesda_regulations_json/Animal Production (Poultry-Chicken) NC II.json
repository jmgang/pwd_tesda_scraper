The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \no The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain b oth in -school and in -\nindustry training or fieldwork components. Details can be referred to \nthe Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and \nRegulations.  \no Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed  to progress at his own pace. \nThe trainer facilitates the training delivery  \no Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners \nare given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \no Supervised industry training or on -the-job training is a n approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the \ntrainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire \nspecific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \no Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of \nthe instruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in \nthe same place. Distance learning may employ correspondence \nstudy, or audio, video or computer technologies.  \no Project -Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or \nstrategy in which students plan, implement and evaluate projects \nthat have real world applications.",
