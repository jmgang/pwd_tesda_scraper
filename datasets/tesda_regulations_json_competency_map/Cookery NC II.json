Delivery should be guided by the 10 basic principles of \ncompetency - based TVET.  \n   The training is based on curriculum developed from the      \ncompetency standards;  \n    Learning is modular in its structure;  \n    Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n    Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n    Training materials are directly related to  the competency  \nstandards and the curriculum modules;  \n   Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the \nperformance of work to the industry required standard;  \n    Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n   Allows for recognition of prior  learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n    Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n    Approved training programs are Nationally Accredited  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of \ndelivery modes, both on and off - the - job as long  as the learning is driven \nby the competency standards specified by the industry. The following \ntraining modalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would c ontain both in - school \nand in - industry training or fieldwork components. Details can \nbe referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing \nRules and Regulations  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own \npace. The trainer just facilitates the training delivery  \n     Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast \nlearners are given the opportunity to assist the slow learners",
