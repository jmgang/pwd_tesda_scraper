The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery   \n shall be guided by the principles of competency - based TVET .  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry \nor recognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by \ncompetencies written to industry standards)  \n \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self - paced learning strategies;  \n \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance \nof work to the industry req uired standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and \nattitude into account but requires evidence of actual performance of \nthe competency as the primary source of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning ( RPL) or \ncurrent competencies;  \n \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all \nspecified competencies.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on - and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven  by the \nc ompetency standards specified by the industry.  The following training \nmodalities and their variations/components may be adopted singly or in \ncombination with other modalities when designing and delivering training \nprograms:  \n \n2.1     Institution  -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) \nwhich contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the \nImplementing Rules and Regulations of the DTS Law and the \nTESDA Guidelines on  the DTP;  \n \n  The traditional classroom - based or in - center instruction may \nbe enhanced through use of learner - centered methods as \nwell as laboratory or field - work components.",
