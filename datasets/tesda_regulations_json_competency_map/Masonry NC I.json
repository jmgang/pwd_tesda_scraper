Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry \nor recognized industry sector; ( Learning system is driven by \ncompetenc ies written to industry standards ) \n \nb. Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self -paced learning strategies;  \n \nc. Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of m odern technology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance \nof work to the industry required standards;  \n \ne. Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and \nattitude into account but requires evidence of actual performan ce of \nthe competency as the primary source of evidence.  \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or \ncurrent competencies;  \n \ng. Training completion is based on satisfactory completion of all \nspecified competencies not on the specified no minal duration of \nlearning.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of \ndelivery modes, both on -and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven \nby the competency standards specified by the industry.  The following \ntraining modalities and their variations/components may be adopted \nsingly or in combination with other modalities when designing and \ndelivering training programs:  \n \n2.1 Institution - Based:  \n \n• Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) \nwhich contain both in -school an d in-industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Implementing Rules \nand Regulations of the DTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on \nthe DTP;",
