The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended, \nthus, programs would con tain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training \nSystem (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwhere the trainee is allo wed to progress at his own pace. The trainer \nonly facilitates the training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners \nare given the opportunity to assist the slow learners  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job traini ng is a training \napproach designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee \nthrough actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies prescribed in the training regulations  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in whic h majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, \nvideo or computer technologies  \n \n \n 3.3  TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nTrainees or students who wish to en ter this training should possess the \nfollowing requirements:  \n \n  can communicate in basic English in both oral and written form  \n  physically and mentally fit  \n  with good moral character  \n  can perform basic mathematical computation  \n \n   This  list does not include sp ecific institutional requirements such as \neducational attainment, appropriate work experience, and others that may be \nrequired of the trainees by the school or training center delivering the TVET \nprogram.",
