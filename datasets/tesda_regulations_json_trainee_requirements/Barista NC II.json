Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \n• The training is based o n curriculum developed from the  competency standards;  \n• Learning is modular in its structure;  \n• Training delivery is individualized and self -paced;  \n• Training is based on work that must be  performed;  \n• Training materials are dir ectly related to the competency  standards and the \ncurriculum modules;  \n• Assessment is based on th e collection of evidence of the  performance of work \nto the industry required standard;  \n• Training is based both on and off -the-job components;  \n• Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current  competencies;  \n• Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n• Approved training programs are Nationally Accredited  \n \nThe competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of de livery \nmodes, both on and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry. The following training modalities may be adopted \nwhen designing training programs:  \n \n• The dualized mode of training delivery is pre ferred and recommended, thus, \nprograms would contain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations  \n• Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training modality where \nthe trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer only facilitates \nthe training delivery  \n• Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given \nthe opportunity to assist the slow learners  \n• Supervised industry training or on -the-job training is a training approach \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in the \ntraining regulations  \n• Distanc e learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place. \nDistance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video or \ncomputer technologies  \n \n \n3.3 TRAINEE ENTRY RE QUIREMENTS  \n \nTrainees or students wishing to gain entry into this qualification should possess the \nfollowing requirements:  \n \n• Must have completed a 10-year basic education  \n• Good in  oral and written communication",
