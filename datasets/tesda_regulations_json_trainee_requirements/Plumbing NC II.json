The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum  and guided by the \nprinciples of competency - based TVET.  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies \nwritten to industry standards)  \n \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate individualized \nand self - paced learning strategies;  \n \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd.  Asse ssment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as \nthe primary source of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on - and off - the - job as long as learning is guided by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry.  The following training modalities and its \nvariations/components may b e adopted singly or in combination with other \nmodalities when designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1     Institution -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in - school and in - industry training or fie ldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Implementing Rules and \nRegulations of the DTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of \nthe instruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the \nsame place. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, \naudio, video, computer technologies or other modern t echnology \nthat can be used to facilitate learning and formal and non - formal",

Specific guidelines on this mode shall be issued by the \nTESDA Secretariat.  \n  The traditional classroom - based or in - center instruction may be \nenhanced through use of learner - centered methods as well as \nlaboratory or field - work components.  \n \n 2.2       Enterprise - Based:  \n \n  Formal Apprenticeship  –  Training within employment involving a \ncontract between an apprentice and an enterprise on an approved \napprenticeable occupation.  \n \n  Informal Apprenticeship  -  is based on a training (and working) \nagreement between an apprentice and a master craftsperson wherein \nthe agreement may be written or oral and the master craftsperson \ncommits to training the apprentice in all the skills relevant to his or her \ntrade over a significant period of time, usually between one and four \nyears, while the apprentice commits to contributing productively to the \nwork of the business. Training is integrated into the production \nprocess and apprentices learn by wo rking alongside the experienced \ncraftsperson.  \n \n  Enterprise - based Training -  where training is implemented within the \ncompany in accordance with the requirements of the specific \ncompany.  Specific guidelines on this mode shall be issued by the \nTESDA Secretari at.  \n \n2.3  Community - Based –  Community - Based –  short term programs conducted \nby non - government organizations (NGOs), LGUs, training centers and \nother TVET providers which are intended to address the specific needs of \na community.  Such programs can be cond ucted in informal settings such \nas barangay hall, basketball courts, etc.  These programs can also be \nmobile training program (MTP).",
