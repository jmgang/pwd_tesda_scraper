The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n• The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. \nThus programs would contain both in -school and in -industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training \nSystem (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n• Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer \nfacilitates the training delivery  \n• Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n• Supervised industry training or on -the-job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee \nthrough actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n• Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same",
