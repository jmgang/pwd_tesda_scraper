The f ollowing training modalities \nmay be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and in - \nindustry training or fieldwork components. Details can be referred to \nthe Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and \nRegulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. \nThe trainer facilitates the training delivery  \n  Pee r teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners \nare given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.",
