The following training modalities \nmay be  adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and in - \nindustry training or fieldwork components. Details can be referred to \nthe Dual Training Syste m (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer \nfacilitates the training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners \nare given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee \nthrough actual experience in th e workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of \nthe instruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the \nsame place. Distance learning m ay employ correspondence study, or \naudio, video or computer technologies.  \n  Project - Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or \nstrategy in which students plan, implement and evaluate projects that \nhave real world applications.",
