Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \n• The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency \nstandards;  \n• Learning is modular in its structure;  \n• Training delivery is individualized and self -paced;  \n• Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n• Training materials are directly related to the compe tency standards and the \ncurriculum modules;  \n• Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work \nto the industry required standard;  \n• Training is based both on and off -the-job components;  \n• Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL)  or current competencies;  \n• Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n• Approved training programs are nationally accredited.  \n \nThe competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on and off -the-job as long as the learning i s driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry. The following training modalities may be adopted \nwhen designing training programs:  \n \n• The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus \nprograms would contain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n• Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training modality wherein \nthe trainee is allowed to progre ss at his own pace. The trainer just facilitates \nthe training delivery.  \n• Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given \nthe opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n• Supervised industry training or on -the-job training is an ap proach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.  \n• Distance learning is a formal education process in which majo rity of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place. \nDistance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video or \ncomputer technologies.  \n• Project -based instruction is an authentic instructional model strategy in w hich \nstudents plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world \napplications.",
