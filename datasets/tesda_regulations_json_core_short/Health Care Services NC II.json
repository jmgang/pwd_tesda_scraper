Delivery should be \nguided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the competen cy standards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency standards and the curriculum \nmodules;  \n  Assess ment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to the \nindustry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for mult iple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are nationally accredited.  \nThe competency –  based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, both \non and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards specified by  \nthe industry.  \n \n  The following training modalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus programs \nwould contain both in - school and in –  industry training or fieldwork co mponents. Details \ncan be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality wherein the trainee \nis allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer facilitates  the training delivery  \n \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given the \nopportunity to assist the slow learners  \n \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training designed to \nenhance the knowl edge an skills of the trainee through actual experience in the workplace \nto acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the instruction occurs \nwhen the students  and instructor are not in the same place. Distance learning may \nemploy correspondence study, or audio, video or computer technologies.   \n \n  Project - Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or strategy in which students \nplan, implement and evalu ate projects that have real world applicants.",
