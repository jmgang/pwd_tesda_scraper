The delivery of training shall adhere to the desi gn of the curriculum. Delivery shall \nbe guided by the principles of com petency -based TVET.  \n \na. Course design is based on competency standards set by the in dustry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies written \nto industry standards)  \n \nb. Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate i ndividualized \nand self -paced learning strate gies;  \n \nc. Training can be done on an act ual workplace setting, simulation of a workplace \nand/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work t o \nthe industry required standards;  \n \ne. Assessme nt of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the \nprimary source of evidence.  \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition o f prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetenci es; \n \ng. Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on -and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandar ds specified by the industry.  The fo llowing training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other \nmodalities when designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1     Institution -Based:  \n \n• Dual Training Syst em (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (D TP) which \ncontain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork components. \nDetails can be referred to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the \nDTS Law and the TES DA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n \n• Distance learning  is a formal education process in whi ch majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, \nvideo, computer tec hnologies or other modern technology that ca n be \nused to facilitate learning and formal and non -formal training. Specific \nguidelines on this mode shall be issued by the TESDA Secretariat.  \n \n \n• The classroom -based or in -center instruction uses of learner -cente red \nmethods as well as laboratory or field -work components.",
