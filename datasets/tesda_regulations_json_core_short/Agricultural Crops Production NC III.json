The following training modalities may be adopted when designing training \nprograms:  \n   The dualized mode of trainin g delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus programs \nwould contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork components. Details can \nbe referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n   Modular/self - paced learning  is a competency - based training modality wherein the trainee \nis allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just facilitates the training delivery.  \n   Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given the \nopportunity to assi st the slow learners.  \n   Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training designed to \nenhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual experience in the \nworkplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n   Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the instruction occurs \nwhen the students and instructor are not in the same place. Distance learning may \nemploy correspondence study, audio, video or computer techn ologies.  \n \n \n3.3  TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nTrainees or students wishing to gain entry into this course should possess the following \nrequirements:  \n \n  can communicate either oral and written  \n  physically  and mentally fit  \n  with good moral character  \n  can perform ba sic mathematical computation  \n \nThis list does not include specific institutional requirements such as educational \nattainment, appropriate work experience, and others that may be required of the trainees by \nthe school or training center delivering the TVET p rogram.  \n \n \n3.4  TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS  \nAGRICULTURAL CROPS PRODUCTION  NC III   \n \nRecommended list of tools, equipment and materials for the training of 25 trainees for \nAgricultural Crops NC III   \n \nTOOLS  EQUIPMENT  MATERIALS  \nQTY  DESCRIPTION  QTY  DESCRIPT ION  QTY  DESCRIPTION  \n25 pcs    Bolos  2    Booth/temporary \nshed  250 pcs.    Agri bags, plastic  \n10 pcs    Broomstick  5    Cart (Kariton & \nparagus)  500 pcs.    Bamboo stick  \n5 pcs    Calculator  1    Coolroom  5 pcs.    Basket  \n5 pcs    Container  1    Comb - tooth harrow  5 rims    Bond paper  \n5 se ts    Cutting tools  5    Computer with \nrecord keeping 5 pcs.    Catching nets",
