Delivery \nshall be guided  by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET:  \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the \ncompetency standards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate \nindivid ualized and self - pa ced learning strategies;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency  \n  standards and the curriculum modules;  \n  Assessment is based on the collection of evidence of the  \n performance of work to the industry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning  \n (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Training programs are register ed with the UTPRAS.  \n \n  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the \ncompetency standards specified by the industry.  The following training \nmodalities may be ado pted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus \nprograms would contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents.  Details can be referred to the Dual Training System ( DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n  Modular/self - paced is a competency - based training modality wherein the \ntrainee is allowed to progress at his/her own pace.  The trainer only facilitates \nthe training delivery.  \n \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training  modality wherein fast learners are given \nthe opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n \n  Supervised Industry Training or On - the - Job Training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through \nactual experience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies \nprescribed in the training regulations.  \n \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place.  \nDistance learni ng may employ correspondence study, or audio, video or \ncomputer technologies.  \n \n  Project - based instruction is an authentic instructional model or strategy in \nwhich students plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world \napplications.",

PV Module  –  a device composed of solar cells that convert light or energy from the \nsun to electricity.  \n \n3.  PV Panel  –  a group of PV m odules connected in series and/or parallel in a single \nsupport structure  \n \n4.  PV Array  –  a group of PV modules connected in series and/or parallel in different \nsupport structures  \n \n5.  Load  –  are devices such as lighting fixtures, appliances, or the likes that requ ires \nelectricity  \n \n6.  Battery  –  a device that stores electricity typically rated in Ampere - hours. For PV \nsystems in the Philippines, car batteries are commonly used.  \n \n7.  Controller –  an electronic device used to cut off charging to the battery when the \nbattery is  full and to disconnect the battery from the load when the battery charge is \ngetting low  \n \n8.  Direct current  –  unidirectional flow of electricity, usually type of power being stored in \nbatteries  \n \n9.  Alternating current  –  current that periodically changes its magn itude and direction, \ncommonly derived directly from the grid - connected power sources  \n \n10.  Functional Test  –  test procedures being done on the different PV components based \non their rated operating ranges such as controller set - points, battery voltage, Voc and \nIsc of PV modules.  \n \n11.  Controller Set - points  –  the maximum and minimum settings that corresponds to the \npredetermined depth of discharge and maximum charge of a battery  \n \n12.  Maximum depth of discharge  –  is the state of charge of a battery that will provide \nmaximu m life cycles before it needs replacement  \n \n13.  Commissioning  –  the process in which a machine or system is put in operation  \n \n14.  Installation data sheet  –  record or document of information containing the final \ninstallation lay - out and system specification  \n \n15.  Power  –  the delivery of energy typically measured in Watts  \n \n16.  Energy  –  actual work done by the electricity, typically measured in Watt - hours",

Elective Competencies   -   are the additional skills and knowledge required by  the \nindividual  or enterprise for work  \n \n29.  Elements  -  are the building blocks of a unit of competency. They describe in outcome \nterms the functions that a person perform s  in the workplace.  \n \n30.  Evidence Guide  -  is a component of the unit of competency that defin es or identifies \nthe evidences required to determine the competence of the individual. It provides \ninformation on critical aspects of competency, underpinning knowledge, underpinning \nskills, resource implications, assessment method and context of assessmen t  \n \n31.  Level  -  refers to the category of skills and knowledge required to do a job  \n \n32.  Method of Assessment  -  refers to the ways of collecting evidence and when, \nevidence should be collected",
