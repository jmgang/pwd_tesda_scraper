Delivery \nshou ld be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the  competency \nstandards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency standards and \nthe curriculum modules;  \n  Assessment is based on the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standard;  \n  Training is based b oth on and off - the - job components;  \n  Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are Nationally Accredited  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes va rious types of delivery \nmodes, both on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the \ncompetency standards specified by the industry. The following training modalities \nmay be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of trainin g delivery is preferred and recommended, \nthus, programs would contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training \nSystem (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwhere the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer \nonly facilitates the training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist th e slow learners  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is a training approach \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through \nactual experience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies \nprescribed in the training re gulations  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, \nvideo or computer technologies",
