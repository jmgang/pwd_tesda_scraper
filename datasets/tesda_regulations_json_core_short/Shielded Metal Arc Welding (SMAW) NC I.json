The following \ntraining modalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n   The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus \nprograms would co ntain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n   Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is  allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just \nfacilitates the training delivery.  \n   Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n   Supervised industry training or on - the - j ob training is an approach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.  \n   Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video or \ncomputer technologies.",
