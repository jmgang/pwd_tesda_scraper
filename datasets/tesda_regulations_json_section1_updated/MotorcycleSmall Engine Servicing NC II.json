The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery  \n shall be guided by the principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \na. Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies \nwritten to industry standards)  \n \nb. Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate individualized \nand self -paced learning strategies;  \n \nc. Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standards;  \n \ne. Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as \nthe primary source of evidence.  \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng. Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on -and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards \nspecified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other modalities \nwhen designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1     Institution - Based:  \n \n• Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Implementing Rules and \nRegulations of the DTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n \n• The traditional classroom -based or in -center instruction may be \nenhanced through use of learner -centered methods as well as \nlaboratory or field -work components.",

It may drive a \nvariety of imm obile equipment such as  pumps and \ngenerators .  \n \nA 2-stroke, or 2 -cycle engine is a type of internal \ncombustion engine which completes a power cycle \nwith two strokes (up and down movements) of the \npiston during only one crankshaft revolution.  \n \n4. 4-stroke engine  A 4-stroke, or 4 -cycle engine is a type of internal \ncombustion engine which completes a power cycle \nwith 4 strokes (up and down movements) of the \npiston during only one crankshaft revolution.  \n \n5. Multi -cylinder engines  Is a reciprocating internal combustion engine with \nmultiple cylinders.  \n \n6. Fuel system  System responsible for the supply of fuel into the \nengine for combustion.  \n \n7. Intake system  System responsible for the supply of air into the \nengine for combustion.  \n \n8. Exhaust system  System responsible for the control and directs \nburned exhaust gases into the atmosphere.  \n \n9. Lubrication system  System responsible for the continuous supply of oil \nduring engine operation not only to prevent wear to \nmoving parts of the engine and transmission but \nalso to cool, remove impurities and to neutralize \nchemically active products of combustion in the \nengine.  \n \n10. Cooling system  \n \n \n \n System responsible to maintain working \ntemperature of the engine while in operation to \nprevent overheating and wear of engine parts.  \n \n11. Clutch and \nTransmission system  \n \n System responsible to convert the power produced \nby the engine into the desirable torque needed by \nthe rear wheel .",
