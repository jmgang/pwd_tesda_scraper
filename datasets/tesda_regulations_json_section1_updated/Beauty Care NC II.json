            "page_content": "TR Beauty Care NC II  Promulgated August 2005  - 1 - 3.2 TRAINING DELIVERY  \n \nThe delivery of training should adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery should be \nguided by the 10 basic principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \n• The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency standards;  \n• Learning is modular in its structure;  \n• Training delivery is individualized and self -paced;  \n• Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n• Training materials are di rectly related to the competency standards and the curriculum \nmodules;  \n• Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to the \nindustry required standard;  \n• Training is based both on and off -the-job components;  \n• Allows for recognit ion of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n• Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n• Approved training programs are nationally accredited.  \n \nThe competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, both \non and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards specified by \nthe industry. The following training modalities may be adopted when designing training \nprograms:  \n \n• The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus program s \nwould contain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork components. Details can \nbe referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n• Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training modality wherein the trainee \nis allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just facilitates the training delivery.  \n \n• Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given the \nopportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n \n• Supervised industry training o r on-the-job training is an approach in training designed to \nenhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual experience in the \nworkplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n \n• Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the instruction occurs \nwhen the students and instructor are not in the same place. Distance learning may \nemploy correspondence study, audio, video or computer technologies.  \n \n• Project -based instruction is an authentic i nstructional model strategy in which students \nplan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world applications.  \n \n \n3.3 TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nTrainees or students wishing to gain entry into these qualifications should possess the \nfollowing requi rements:  \n \n• MUST be able to communicate effectively both orally and in written form  \n• MUST be physically, emotionally, psychologically and mentally fit  \n• MUST be able to perform basic mathematical computation",
