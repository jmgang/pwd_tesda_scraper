The following training modalities may be \nadopted when designing training programs:  \n \n   The dualized mode of training del ivery is preferred and recommended. \nThus programs would contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System \n(DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n   Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just \nfacilitates the training delivery.  \n \n   Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n \n   Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee \nthrough actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies prescribed in the tr aining regulations.  \n \n   Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video \nor computer techno logies.  \n \n     Project - based instruction is an authentic instructional model strategy in \nwhich students plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world \napplications.  \n \n \n3.3  TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nTrainees or students wishing to gain entry into these qualifications should \npossess the following requirements:  \n \n  Must be able to communicate effectively both orally and in written form  \n  Must be physically, emotionally, psychologically and mentally fit  \n  Must be able to perform basic mathematical computatio n s",
