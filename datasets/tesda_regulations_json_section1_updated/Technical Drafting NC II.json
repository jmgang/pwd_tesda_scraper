Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency -based TVET:  \n \n• The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency \nstandards;  \n• Learning is modular in its structure;  \n• Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self -paced learning strategies;  \n• Train ing is based on work that must be performed;  \n• Training materials are directly related to the competency standards \nand the curriculum modules;  \n• Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the \nperformance of work to the industry required standard;  \n• Training is based both on and off -the-job components;  \n• Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or \ncurrent competencies;  \n• Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n• Training programs are registered with the UTPRAS.  \n \nThe competenc y-based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry. The following training modalities may be \nadopted when designing training progra ms: \n• The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in -school and in -\nindustry training or fieldwork components. Details can be referred to \nthe Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and \nRegulatio ns. \n• Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. \nThe trainer facilitates the training delivery  \n• Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners \nare given  the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n• Supervised industry training or on -the-job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee \nthrough actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompeten cies prescribed in the training regulations.",

Distance learning may employ correspondence \nstudy, or aud io, video or computer technologies.  \n• Project -Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or \nstrategy in which students plan, implement and evaluate projects \nthat have real world applications.  \n \n \n3.3 TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nThis section specifies the qualifications of trainees and educational experience. \nOther requirements like health and physical requirements are also stated.
