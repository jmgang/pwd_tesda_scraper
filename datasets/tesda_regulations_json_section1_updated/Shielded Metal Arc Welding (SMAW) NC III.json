The following \ntraining modalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n   The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus \nprograms would contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n   Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trai ner just \nfacilitates the training delivery.  \n   Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n   Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training \ndesigne d to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.  \n   Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction o ccurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video or \ncomputer technologies.",
