Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to \nthe industry required standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the train ee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the \nprimary source of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng.

The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on - and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards \nspecified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their variations/ \ncomponent s may be adopted singly or in combination with other modalities when \ndesigning and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1.  Institution -  Based:  \n \nClassroom - based or school - based training conducted entirely within the school \nor center, with classroom and/or laborator y components.  \n  Dual Training System (DTS) / Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork components.  \n  Supervised Industry Training (SIT) or on - the - job training (OJT) is an \napproach in training designed t o enhance the knowledge and skills of the \ntrainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies as prescribed in the training regulations. It is imperative that \nthe deployment of trainees in the workplace is adhered to trainin g programs \nagreed by the institution and enterprise and status and progress of trainees \nare closely monitored by the training institutions to prevent opportunity for \nwork exploitation.  \n  Project - based instruction is an authentic instructional model or strat egy in \nwhich students plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world \napplications.",
