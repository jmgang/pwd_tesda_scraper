The delivery of training shall adhere to the desi gn of the curriculum. Deli very shall \nbe guided by the principles of competency -based TVET . \n \na. Course des ign is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies written \nto industry standards)  \n \nb. Training delivery  is lear ner-centered and should accommodate individualized \nand self-paced le arning strategies;  \n \nc. Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a workplace \nand/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collec tion of evidence of the performance of work to \nthe industry req uired standar ds; \n \ne. Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the \nprimary source of evidenc e. \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition of prior learning ( RPL) or curre nt \ncompetencies;  \n \ng. Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery m odes, \nboth on -and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven  by the compe tency \nstandards specified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other \nmodalities when des igning a nd delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1     Institution -Based: \n \n• Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork components. \nDetails can be referred to the Implementing Rul es and R egulations of the \nDTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on t he DTP;  \n \n• Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ cor responde nce study, audio, \nvideo, computer technologies or other  modern techn ology that can be \nused to facilitate learning and formal and non -formal training. Specific \nguidelines on this mode shall be issued by the TESDA Secretariat.  \n \n \n• The classroom -based o r in-center instruction uses of learner -centered \nmethods as wel l as laborato ry or field -work components.",
