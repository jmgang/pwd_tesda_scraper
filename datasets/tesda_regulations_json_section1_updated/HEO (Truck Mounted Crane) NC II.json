The following training modalities \nmay be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dua lized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and in - \nindustry training or fieldwork components. Details can be referred to \nthe Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and \nRegulations.  \n  Modular /self - paced learning is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. \nThe trainer facilitates the training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners \nare given the opport unity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the \ntrainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire \nspecific competencies prescr ibed in the training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of \nthe instruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in",
