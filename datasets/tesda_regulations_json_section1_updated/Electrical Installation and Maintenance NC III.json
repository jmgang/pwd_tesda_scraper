The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery  shall \nbe guid ed by the principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies \nwritten to industry standards)  \n \nb.  Training delivery is learner - center ed and should accommodate \nindividualized and self - paced learning strategies;  \n \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence o f the performance of \nwork to the industry required standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as \nthe primary source of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training progr am allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on - and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other \nmodalities when designing and deliver ing training programs:  \n \n2.1.  Institution -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP ) which \ncontain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork components. \nDetails can be referred to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the  \nDTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n \n  Distance learning  is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio,  video, \ncomputer technologies or other modern technology that can be used to \nfacilitate learning and formal and non - formal training. Specific guidelines on \nthis mode shall be issued by the TESDA Secretariat.  \n  The traditional classroom - based or in - center ins truction  may be \nenhanced through use of learner - centered methods as well as laboratory or \nfield - work components.",
