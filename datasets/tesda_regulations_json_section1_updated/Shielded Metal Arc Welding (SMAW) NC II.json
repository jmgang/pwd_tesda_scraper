The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n  The dualized mode of training  delivery is preferred and recommended. \nThus programs would contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System \n(DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning i s a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just \nfacilitates the training delivery.  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe trai ning regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video \nor computer technologi es.",
