Delivery should \nbe guided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency standards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is ind ividualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency standards and the curriculum \nmodules;  \n  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to th e \nindustry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are nationally accredite d.  \n \nThe competency –  based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards \nspecified by the industry. The following training modalities may be adopted when \ndesign ing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus programs \nwould contain both in - school and in –  industry training or fieldwork components. Details \ncan be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementi ng Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality wherein the trainee \nis allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer facilitates the training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein f ast learners are given the \nopportunity to assist the slow learners  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training designed to \nenhance the knowledge an skills of the trainee through actual experience in the \nworkplace to acqui re specific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the instruction \noccurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place. Distance learning \nmay employ correspond ence study, or audio, video or computer technologies.   \n  Project - Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or strategy in which \nstudents plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world applicants.",
