Th e following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \no  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and \nin - industry training or fieldwork components. Details can be \nreferred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules \nand Regulations.  \no  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own \npace. The trainer facilitates the training delivery  \no  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast \nlearners are given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \no  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an \napproach in training designed to enhance the knowledge and \nskills of the t rainee through actual experience in the workplace \nto acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training \nregulations.  \no  Distance learning is a formal education process in which \nmajority of the instruction occurs when the students and \ninstructor are not in the same place. Distance learning may \nemploy correspondence study, or audio, video or computer \ntechnologies.  \no  Project - Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or \nstrategy in which students plan, implement and evaluate \nprojects that have real  world applications.",
