Delivery should be \nguided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET.  \n   \n  The training is based on curriculu m developed from the competency standards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate individualized and self - \npaced learning strategies;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training mate rials are directly related to the competency standards and the curriculum \nmodules;  \n  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to the \nindustry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off the - job components;  \n  Trainin g program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Training programs are registered with UTPRAS.  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, b oth on \nand off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards specified by the \nindustry. The following training modalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and reco mmended. Thus programs \nwould contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork components. Details \ncan be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules and \nRegulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training m odality wherein the \ntrainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer facilitates the training \ndelivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given the \nopportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industr y training or on - the - job training is an approach in training designed to \nenhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual experience in the \nworkplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n  Distance learning i s a formal education process in which majority of the instruction \noccurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place. Distance learning \nmay employ correspondence study, or audio, video or computer technologies.  \n  Project - Based Instruction is a n authentic instructional model or strategy in which \nstudents plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world applications.",
