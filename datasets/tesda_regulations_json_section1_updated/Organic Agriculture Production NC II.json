Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency \nstandards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must  be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency standards and the \ncurriculum modules;  \n  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are nationally accredited.  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes various types o f delivery \nmodes, both on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry. The following training modalities may be adopted \nwhen designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is  preferred and recommended. \nThus programs would contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System \n(DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competen cy - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer \nfacilitates the training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, or audio, \nvideo or computer technologies.  \n  Project - Bas ed Instruction is an authentic instructional model or strategy in \nwhich students plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world \napplications.",
