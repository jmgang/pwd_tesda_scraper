The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. \nDelivery  shall be guided by the principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies \nwritten to industry standards)  \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self - paced learning strategies;  \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standards;  \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude \nin to account but requires evidence of actual performance of the \ncompetency as the primary source of evidence.  \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of  all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of \ndelivery modes, both on - and off - the - job as long as the learning is \ndriven by the competency standards specified by the industry.  The \nfollowing training modalities and their variations/components  may be \nadopted singly or in combination with other modalities when \ndesigning and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1 Institution -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Implementing Rules and \nRegulations of the DTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n \n  The traditional classroom - based or in - center instruction may be \nenhanced through use of learner - centered methods as  well as \nlaboratory or field - work components.  \n \n  Supervised Industry Training (SIT) or on - the - job training (OJT) is an \napproach in training designed to enhance the knowledge and skills \nof the trainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire \nspec ific competencies as prescribed in the training regulations.
