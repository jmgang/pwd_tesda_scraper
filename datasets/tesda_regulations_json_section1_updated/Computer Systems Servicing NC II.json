TRAINING DELIVERY  \n \nThe delivery of training should adhere to the design of the curriculum.  Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of the competency - based TVET.  \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the compete ncy \nstandards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency standards and the \ncurriculum modules;  \n  Asses sment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for mul tiple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are nationally accredited.  \n \nThe competency - based TVET systems recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified b y the industry.  The following training modalities may be \nadopted when designing training programs:  \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended.  Thus \nprograms would contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncompo nents.  Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace.   The trainer \nfacilities t he training delivery.  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowled ge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire a specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students  and instructors are not in the same \nplace.  Distance learning may employ correspondence study, or audio, video \nor computer technologies.",

Computer System   -  The complete computer made up of the CPU, memory and \nrelated electronics (main cabinet), all the peripheral devices connected to it and its \noperating system. Computer syst ems fall into two broad divisions: clients and \nservers. Client machines fall into three categories from low to high end: laptop, \ndesktop and workstation. Servers range from small to large: low - end servers, \nmidrange servers and mainframes.  \n2.  Computer Network ,  or simply a Network , is a collection of computers  and other \nhardware  interconnected by communicat ion channels that allow sharing of resources \nand information. Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive \ndata to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices \nare said to be in a network .

Configuration  -  The makeup of a system. To \"configure\" is to choose options in \norder to create a cus tom system. \"Configurability\" is a system's ability to be changed \nor customized.  \n4.  Connector  -  Any plug and socket that links two devices together. Although taken for \ngranted and rarely in the limelight, connectors are a huge industry, and the quality of \nthe se components is more critical than most people would imagine. When not \ndesigned or constructed properly, they often b ecome the weakest element in an \nelectronic system.  \n5.  Display Adapter  -  A plug - in card in a desktop computer that converts the images \ncreate d in the computer to the electronic signals required by the monitor. It \ndetermines the maximum resolution, refresh rate and number of colors that can be \ndisplayed, which the monitor must also be able to support. On many PC \nmotherboards, the display adapter  circuits are built into the chipset,  and an AGP or \nPCI card is not required.  \n6.  Expansion Board -  A printed circuit board that plugs into an expansion slot and \nextends the computer's capability to control a peripheral device. All the boards \n(cards) that plu g into a computer's bus are expansion boards, such as display \nadapters, disk controllers, network adapters and sound cards.  \n7.  Expansion Bus -  An input/output bus typically comprised of a series of slots on the \nmotherboard. Expansion boards (cards) are plugg ed into the bus. ISA and PCI are \nthe common expansion buses in a PC.  \n8.  Graphical User Interface  -   A graphics - based user interface that incorporates \nmovable windows, icons and a mouse. The ability to resize application windows and \nchange style and size of f onts are the significant advantages of a GUI vs. a \ncharacter - based interface. GUIs have become the standard way users interact with a \ncomputer, and the major GUIs are the Windows and Mac interfaces along with Motif \nfor Unix and the GNOME and KDE interfaces  for Linux.  \n9.  LAN  -  a  local area network (LAN)  is a computer network  that interconnects \ncomputers in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office \nbui lding using network media. The defining characteristics of LANs, in contrast to \nwide area networks  (WANs), include their usually higher data - transfer rates , smaller \ngeographic area, and lack of a need for leased telecommunication lines .  \n10.  Motherboard  -  Also called the \"system board,\" i t is the main printed circuit board in \nan electronic device, which contains sockets that accept additional boards. In a \ndesktop computer, the motherboard contains the CPU, chipset, PCI bus slots, AGP \nslot, memory sockets and controller circuits for the key board, mouse, disks and \nprinter. It may also have built - in controllers for modem, sound, display and network, \nobviating the need to plug in a card.  \n11.  Network s –  see Computer Network.  \n12.  Operating System  -  The master control program that runs the computer. The first \nprogram loaded when the computer is turned on, its main part, the \"kernel,\" resides \nin memory at all times. The operating system sets the standards for all application \nprograms that run in the computer. The applications \"talk to\" the operating system  for \nall user interfaces  and file management operations.",

Peripheral - Any hardware device connected to a computer, such as a monitor, \nkeyboard, printer, disk, tape, graphics tablet, scanner, joy stick, paddle or mouse  \n14.  Server -  A computer system in a network  that is shared by multiple users. Servers \ncome in all sizes from x86 - based PCs to IBM mainframes. A server may have a \nkeyboard, monitor and mouse directly attached, or one keyboard, monitor and mouse \nmay connect to any number of servers via a KVM switch. Servers may be also be \naccessed only through a network connection as well.  \n15.  Sound Card  -  Also called a \"sound board\" or \"audio adapter,\" it is a computer \nexpansion board that records and plays back sound, providing inputs from a \nmicrophone or other sound source and outputs to speakers or an external amplifier. \nThe de facto standard for sound card compatibility in PCs is Creative Labs' Sound \nBlaster.  \n16.  User Interface -  All graphics based today, the user interface includes the windows, \nmenus and method of inte raction between you and the computer. Prior to the Mac, \nWindows and Motif ( UNIX ) interfaces, all interaction was based on commands \nentered by the user. Operating systems may support optional interfaces and allow a \nnew shell, or skin, to be used instead.  \n17.  Vi rus  -  Software used to infect a computer. After the virus code is written, it is buried \nwithin an existing program. Once that program is executed, the virus code is \nactivated and attaches copies of itself to other programs in the system. Infected \nprograms  copy the virus to other programs.  \n18.  WAN  -  a Wide Area Network  (WAN) is a network that covers a broad area (i.e., any \ntelecommunications network  that link s across metropolitan, regional, or national \nboundaries) using private or public  network transports. Business and government \nentities utilize WANs to relay data among  employees, clients, buyers, and suppliers \nfrom various geographical locations.
