3.2   TRAINING DELIVERY  
 
The delivery of training should adhere to the design of the curriculum. 
Delivery should be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based 
TVET.  
  
o  The training is based on curriculum developed from the 
competency standards;  
o  Learning is modular in its structure;  
o  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate 
individu alized and self - paced learning strategies;  
o  Training is based on work that must be performed;  
o  Training materials are directly related to the competency 
standards and the curriculum modules;  
o  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the 
performanc e of work to the industry required standard;  
o  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or 
current competencies;  
o  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  
o  Training programs are registered with UTPRAS.  
 
The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of 
delivery modes, both on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by 
the competency standards specified by the industry. The following training 
modalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  
 
o  The dual ized mode of training delivery is preferred and 
recommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and 
in - industry training or fieldwork components. Details can be 
referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules 
and Regulations.  
o  Modular/ self - paced learning is a competency - based training 
modality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own 
pace. The trainer facilitates the training delivery  
o  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast 
learners are given the opportu nity to assist the slow learners.  
o  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach 
in training designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the 
trainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire 
specific competencies prescri bed in the training regulations.","TR - Agricultural Crop s  Production NCI I                     Promulgated December 2013
