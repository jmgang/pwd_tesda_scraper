Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of co mpetency - based TVET.  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency \nstandards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training material s are directly related to the competency standards and \nthe curriculum modules;  \n  Assessment is based o n the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standard;  \n  Training is based on both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Allows f or recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are Nationally Accredited  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry. The following training modalities may be \nadopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dual -  mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus \nprograms would contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherei n the trainee is allowed to progress at his/her own pace. The trainer \nonly facilitates the training delivery.  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry tr aining or on - the - job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee  \nthrough actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of  the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video \nor computer technologies.",
