The delivery of training shall adhere to the desi gn of the curriculum. Delivery shall \nbe guided by the principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \na. Course de sign is based on competenc y standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies written \nto industry standards)  \n \nb. Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate individualized \nand self -paced l earning strategies;  \n \nc. Train ing can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a workplace \nand/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to \nthe industry required standa rds; \n \ne. Assessment of compet ency takes the t rainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the \nprimary source of evidence.  \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or curr ent \ncompetencies;  \n \ng. Trainin g completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, both \non-and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the comp etency standards specified  \nby the industry .  The following training modalities and their variations/components may be \nadopted singly or in combination with other modalities when designing and delivering \ntraining programs:  \n \n2.1     Institution -Based:  \n \n• Dual Training System (DTS)/Dua lized Training P rogram (DTP) which \ncontain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork components. \nDetails can be referred to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the \nDTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n \n• Distance learning is a formal  education proce ss in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, \nvideo, computer technologies or other modern tech nology that can be \nused to  facilitate lear ning and formal and non -formal training. Specific \nguidelines on this mode shall be issued by the TESDA Secretariat.  \n• The classroom -based or in -center instruction uses of learner -centered \nmethods as well as laborator y or field -work components .",

Training is \nintegrated into the production process and apprentices learn by working \nalongside the experienced craftsperson.  \n \n• Enterprise -based Training - where training is implemented within the \ncompany in accordance with the requirements of the specific company.  \nSpecific guidelines on this mode shall be issued by the TESDA Secretariat.  \n \n2.2   Community -Based – Community -Based – short term programs \nconducted   by non -governm ent organizations (NGOs), LGUs, training \ncenters and other TVET providers which are intended to address the \nspecific needs of a community.
