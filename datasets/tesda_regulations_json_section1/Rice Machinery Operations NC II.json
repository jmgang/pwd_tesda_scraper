The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \no The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in -school and \nin-industry training or fieldwork components. Details can be \nreferred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules \nand Regulations.  \no Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own \npace. The trainer facilitates the training delivery  \no Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast \nlearners are given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \no Supervised industry training or on -the-job training is an \napproach in training designed to enhance the knowledge and \nskills of the trainee through actual experience in the workplace \nto acquire specific competencies prescribed in the training \nregulations.  \no Distance learning is a formal education process in which \nmajority of the instruction occurs when the students and \ninstructor are not in the same place. Distance learning may \nemploy correspondence study, or audio, video or computer \ntechnologies.  \no Project -Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or \nstrategy in which students plan, implement and evaluate \nprojects that have real world applications.",

They are \nclassified according to horsepower rating  \n \nHand Tractor  – machine with power ranging 3 – 16 hp used for tilling and other form of \nfarm task such as cultivating, planting, irrigating and harvesting. These are also \nknown as power tiller, two - wheel tractor or walking tractor  \n \nLand Preparation Machinery  – machines designed to carry out farm work either by \npulling or propel agricultural implements for the purpose of preparing the soil for \nseedbed  \n \nCrop Establishment Machinery  – machinery device whether self -propelled or \npulled/hitch to a wheeled vehicle, used to place seeds or plant into the soil for \npropagation and production of crops  \n \nCrop Care Machinery  – machinery device whether self -propelled or hitch to a wheeled \nvehicle, to provide plant condition free from weeds, pest diseases, including \nprovision to supply for water and nutrients  \n \nDryer Machinery – machinery device powered either by electric motor or internal \ncombustion engine used to lower down or remove available water from the \ngrains through evaporation by the application of heated air  \n \nRice Mill Machinery  – machinery device to process conversion of paddy into rice which \ninvolves the removal of husk and bran to produce milled rice  \n \nMoldboard Plow  – an implement consisting of a warped surface equipped with a \ncutting edge which crumbles and inverts the soil  \n \nTillage Implements  –implement pulled either by a four or two - wheel tractor used to \nbreak and loosen the soil to a desired depth. It includes the mouldboard, disc, \nchisel, subsoiler and middlebreakers  \n \nField Pattern  – an established and efficient plowing pattern, the objective is to minimize \nthe amount of non -working turns and travel distance in a turn  \n \nHarvesting – the process of gathering the useful portion of the crop from the field. In \nthe case of rice, it refers to the gathering of the matured panicles preparatory to \nthreshing",
