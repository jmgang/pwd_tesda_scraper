The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum  and guided \nby the principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry \nor recognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by \ncompetencies written to industry standards)  \n \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self - paced learning strategies;  \n \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workpl ace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance \nof work to the industry required standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and \nattitude into account but requires evidence of actual performance of \nthe competency as the primary source of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or \ncurrent competencies;  \n \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all \nspecified competencies.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on - and off - the - job as long as learning is guided by the competency \nstandards specif ied by the industry.  The following training modalities and its \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other \nmodalities when designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1 Institution -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS)/ Dualized Training Program (DTP) \nwhich contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Implementing Rules and \nRegulations of the DTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n  Distance learning  is a form al education process in which majority \nof the instruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in \nthe same place. Distance learning may employ correspondence \nstudy, audio, video, computer technologies or other modern \ntechnology that can be used to facilitate learning and formal and \nnon - formal training. Specific guidelines on this mode shall be issued \nby the TESDA Secretariat.  \n  The traditional classroom - based  or in - center instruction  may be \nenhanced through use of learner - centered methods as well a s \nlaboratory or field - work components.",
