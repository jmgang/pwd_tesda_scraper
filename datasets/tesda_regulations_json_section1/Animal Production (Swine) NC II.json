The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \no  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and \nin - industry training or fieldwork co mponents. Details can be \nreferred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules \nand Regulations.  \no  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own \npace. The trainer facilitates the training delivery  \no  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast \nlearners are given the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \no  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach \nin training designed to enhance the knowled ge and skills of the \ntrainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire \nspecific competencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \no  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority \nof the instruction occurs when the students a nd instructor are not \nin the same place. Distance learning may employ correspondence \nstudy, or audio, video or computer technologies.  \no  Project - Based Instruction is an authentic instructional model or \nstrategy in which students plan, implement and evaluate p rojects \nthat have real world applications.  \n \n3.3   TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS",
