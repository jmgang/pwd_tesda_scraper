Delivery shall be guided by the 10 basic principles of \ncompetency - b ased TVET:  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the  \n competency standards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is learner - centered and should  \n                           accommodate individualized and self - paced learning   \n                           strategies;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  Training materials are directly related to the competency  \n  standards and the curriculum modules;  \n  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the  \n perform ance of work to the industry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job components;  \n  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning  \n (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Training progr ams are registered with the UTPRAS.  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes various \ntypes of delivery modes, both on and off - the - job as long as the \nlearning is driven by the competency standards specified by the \nindustry.  The following training modal ities may be adopted when \ndesigning training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - \nschool and in - industry training or fieldwork components.  \nDetails can be referred to the Dual T raining System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n  Modular/self - paced is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his \nown pace.  The trainer facilitates the training delivery.  \n \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a t raining modality wherein fast \nlearners are given the opportunity to assist the slow \nlearners.  \n \n  Supervised Industry Training or On - the - Job Training  is an \napproach in training designed to enhance the knowledge \nand skills of the trainee through actual experie nce in the \nworkplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.",
