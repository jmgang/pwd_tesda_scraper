The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. \nThus programs would contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork com ponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training \nSystem (DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer \nfacilitates t he training delivery  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in \ntraining designed to enhance the knowledg e and skills of the trainee \nthrough actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetencies prescribed in the training regulations.  \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students an d instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, or audio, \nvideo or computer technologies.",

Final Drive  The end of the drive train before power is transmitted  \nto the wheels .  \n \n12.  Fuel Injection  An electronic system that increases the performance ad fuel \neconomy because it monitors engine conditions and \nprovides the correct air/fuel mixture based on the engine’s \ndemand. It injects fuel directly into the cylinder head \nenabling more precise control over the quantity used.  \n \n13. Governor  \n A speed sensing device that employs centrifugal force and \nspring tension to govern engine speed.  \n \n14. Hotchkiss Drive  The type of rear suspension in which leaf springs absorbs \nthe rear axle housing t orque.  \n \n15. Intake Manifold  \n Tubing attached to the engine through which the air/fuel \nmixture reaches the cylinder.",

Ignition System  Electrical system devised to produce timed sparks from \nengine spark plug. Consisting of a battery, induction coil, \nca pacitor, distributor, spark plugs and relevant switches and \nwiring.  \n \n17. Master Cylinder  The liquid - filled cylinder in the hydraulic brake system or \nclutch, where hydraulic pressure is developed when \ndepresses a foot pedal.  \n \n18.  Periodic \nMaintenance \nServ ice  \n The regular servicing prescribed by manufacturer to \nmaintain the vehicle’s top performance.  \n \n19. Positive Crank \nVentilation  Emission control system that prevents crank case gases \nfrom entering the atmosphere, usually by drawing the gases \nfrom the cra nk case and feeding them into the engine’s \ninduction system.  \n \n20. Power Steering  Steering that has been designed to make the wheel move \nmore easily than in a manual steering system. Hydraulic \nassists the process utilizing hydraulic fluid. The fluid \nincrea ses pressure in the power steering pump and aids in \nthe movement of the steering mechanism. This fluid, called \npower steering fluid, is what is replaced at regular intervals \nto keep steering soft and comfortable.  \n \n21. Super Charged \nEngine  An engine that i s similar to a turbo - charged engine which \nuses a series of belts or chains from the crankshaft to turn \nthe turbines that forces the air/fuel mixture into the cylinder \nheads under pressure creating a bigger explosion which \ngenerates more power. A turbocharg er uses the exhaust \ngases to turn the turbines to create the same effect.  \n \n22. Transaxle  Type of construction in which the transmission and \ndifferential are combined in one unit.  \n \n23. Thermostat  \n A device for automatic regulation of temperature  \n24. Turb o Charged \nEngine  A performance - increasing turbine positioned in the exhaust \nsystem. Expanding exhaust gases spin an impeller (very \nsmall fan - type blades) at speeds up to 25 thousand rpm, \ndriving a similar compressing impeller. Compressed air from \nthe drive n impeller is forced into the induction system, which \nsqueezes more air/fuel mixture into the combustion \nchambers. With the greater charge of air and fuel, a more \npowerful combustion burn results, thus more power. The big \nadvantage of the turbo over direct ly driven superchargers is \nthe increased efficiency, although there is a slight lag before \nthe turbine spins up and increases the power output. \nOriginally turbo were developed to enable aircraft to fly at \nhigh altitudes, then they found use in diesel truck s and train \nengines to increase their torque.  \n \n25. U - joint  \n A four - joint cross - connected to two U - shaped yokes that \nserve as a flexible coupling between shafts.",
