The delivery of training shall a dhere to the desi gn of the curriculum. Delivery shall be \nguided by the principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \na. Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies writte n to \nindustry standards)  \n \nb. Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate individualized and \nself-paced learning strategies;  \n \nc. Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a workplace \nand/or through adoption of modern tech nology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to \nthe industry required standards;  \n \ne. Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the \nprimary source of evidence.  \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng. Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET sy stem recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on -and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in  combination with other \nmodalities when designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1     Institution -Based:  \n \n Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork components. \nDeta ils can be referred to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the \nDTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the DTP;  \n \n Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the s ame \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video, \ncomputer technologies or other modern technology that can be used to \nfacilitate learning and formal and non -formal training. Specific guidelines \non this mode shall be issued by the  TESDA Secretariat.",
