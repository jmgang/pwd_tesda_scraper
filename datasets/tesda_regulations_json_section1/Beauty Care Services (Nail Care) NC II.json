Delivery \nshould be guided by the 10 basic principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \n  The training is based on curriculum developed from the competency standards;  \n  Learning is modular in its structure;  \n  Training delivery is individualized and self - paced;  \n  Training is based on work that must be performed;  \n  T raining materials are directly related to the competency standards and the \ncurriculum modules;  \n  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to \nthe industry required standard;  \n  Training is based both on and off - the - job compone nts;  \n  Allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current competencies;  \n  Training allows for multiple entry and exit; and  \n  Approved training programs are nationally accredited.  \n \nThe competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes , \nboth on and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the competency standards \nspecified by the industry. The following training modalities may be adopted when \ndesigning training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and r ecommended. Thus \nprograms would contain both in - school and in - industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based traini ng modality wherein the \ntrainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just facilitates the \ntraining delivery.  \n \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are given the \nopportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n \n  Superv ised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in the \ntraining regulations.  \n \n  Distan ce learning is a formal education process in which majority of the instruction \noccurs when the students and instructor are not in the same place. Distance \nlearning may employ correspondence study, audio, video or computer \ntechnologies.  \n \n  Project - based instr uction is an authentic instructional model strategy in which \nstudents plan, implement and evaluate projects that have real world applications.",
