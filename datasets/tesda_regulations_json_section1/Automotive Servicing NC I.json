The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. \nDelivery shall be guided by the principles of competency - based \nTVET.  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry \nor reco gnized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by \ncompetencies written to industry standards)  \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self - paced learning strategies;  \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace se tting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance \nof work to the industry required standards;  \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and atti tude \ninto account but requires evidence of actual performance of the \ncompetency as the primary source of evidence.  \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or \ncurrent competencies;  \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory perform ance of all \nspecified competencies.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of \ndelivery modes, both on - and off - the - job as long as the learning is \ndriven by the competency standards specified by the industry. The \nfollowing training moda lities and their variations/components may be \nadopted singly or in combination with other modalities when \ndesigning an d delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1  S chool/Institution -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS) which contain both in - school and in - \nindustry train ing or fieldwork components. Details can be referred to \nthe Implementing Rules and Regulations of the DTS Law;  \n \n  The traditional classroom - based or in - center instruction may be \nenhanced through use of learner - centered methods as well as \nlaboratory or field - work components.  \n \n2.2  Enterprise - Based:  \n \n  Enterprise - based Training -  where training is implemented within the \ncompany in accordance with the requirements of the specific \ncompany.  Specific guidelines on this mode shall be issued by the \nTESDA Secretariat.",

Expanding exhaust gases spin an impeller (very \nsmall fan - type blades) at speeds up to 25 tho usand rpm, \ndriving a similar compressing impeller. Compressed air \nfrom the driven impeller is forced into the induction system, \nwhich squeezes more air/fuel mixture into the combustion \nchambers. With the greater charge of air and fuel, a more \npowerful comb ustion burn results, thus more power. The \nbig advantage of the turbo over directly driven \nsuperchargers is the increased efficiency, although there is \na slight lag before the turbine spins up and increases the \npower output. Originally turbo was  developed t o enable \naircraft to fly at high altitudes, then they found use in diesel \ntrucks and train engines to increase their torque.  \n \nU - joint  A four - joint cross - connected to two U - shaped yokes that \nserve as a flexible coupling between shafts.  \n \nVehicle performanc e  It refers to operational and functional condition of the \nvehicle.  \n \nVehicle reference \nmaterials  Materials which  contains information for  operations, \nmaintenance and repair of vehicles.  \n \n \nWash bay  Area where the vehicle is washed after service.",
