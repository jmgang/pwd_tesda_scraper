The following  training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n•  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. Thus \nprograms would contain both in -school and in -industry training or fieldwork \ncomponents. Details can be referred  to the Dual Training System (DTS) \nImplementing Rules and Regulations.  \n•  Modular/self -paced learning is a competency -based training modality \nwherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just \nfacilitates the training delivery.",
