The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery \nshall be guided by the principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \na.  Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; ( Learning system is driven by \ncompetencies written to industry standards )  \n \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate \nindividualized and self - paced learning strategie s;  \n \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a \nworkplace and/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of \nwork to the industry required standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude \ninto account but requires evidence of actual performance of the \ncompetency as the primary source of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory completion of all specified \ncompetencies not on the specified nominal duration of learning.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery \nmodes, both on - and off - the - job as long as the learning is driven by the \ncompetency standards specified by the industry.  The following training \nmodalities and their variations/components  may be adopted singly or in \ncombination with other modalities when designing and delivering training \nprograms:  \n \n2.1  Institution -  Based:  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS)/Dualized Training Program (DTP) \nwhich contain both in - school and in - industry training or field work \ncomponents. Details can be referred to the Implementing Rules and \nRegulations of the DTS Law and the TESDA Guidelines on the \nDTP;  \n \n  Distance learning is a formal education process in which majority \nof the instruction occurs when the students and instru ctor are not in \nthe same place. Distance learning may employ correspondence \nstudy, audio, video, computer technologies or other modern \ntechnology that can be used to facilitate learning and formal and \nnon - formal training. Specific guidelines on this mode s hall be \nissued by the TESDA Secretariat.",

Training is \nintegrated into the production process and apprentices learn by \nworking alongside the experienced craftsperson.  \n \n  Enterprise - based Training -  where training is implemented within \nthe company in accordan ce with the requirements of the specific \ncompany.  Specific guidelines on this mode shall be issued by the \nTESDA Secretariat.  \n \n2.3  Community - Based –  Community - Based –  short term programs \nconducted by non - government organizations (NGOs), LGUs, training \ncenters  and other TVET providers which are intended to address the \nspecific needs of a community.  Such programs can be conducted in \ninformal settings such as barangay hall, basketball courts, etc.  These \nprograms can also be mobile training program (MTP).",
