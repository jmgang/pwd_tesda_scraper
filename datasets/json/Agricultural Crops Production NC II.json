The following training \nmodalities may be adopted when designing training programs:  \n \no  The dual ized mode of training delivery is preferred and \nrecommended. Thus programs would contain both in - school and \nin - industry training or fieldwork components. Details can be \nreferred to the Dual Training System (DTS) Implementing Rules \nand Regulations.  \no  Modular/ self - paced learning is a competency - based training \nmodality wherein the trainee is allowed to progress at his own \npace. The trainer facilitates the training delivery  \no  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast \nlearners are given the opportu nity to assist the slow learners.  \no  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach \nin training designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the \ntrainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire \nspecific competencies prescri bed in the training regulations.",
