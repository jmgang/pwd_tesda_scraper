The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery shall be \nguided by the principles of competency - based TVET.  \n \na.  Course design is ba sed on competency standards set by the industry or recognized \nindustry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies written to industry \nstandards)  \n \nb.  Training delivery is learner - centered and should accommodate individualized and \nself - paced learning st rategies;  \n \nc.  Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a workplace \nand/or through adoption of modern technology (Video Conferencing, Webinar, etc).  \n \nd.  Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to the  \nindustry required standards;  \n \ne.  Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into account \nbut requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the primary \nsource of evidence.  \n \nf.  Training program allows for recognition of pri or learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng.  Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2.  The competency - based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, both \non - and off - the - job as long as the learn ing is driven by the competency standards \nspecified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other modalities \nwhen designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1.  Institu tion -  Based:  \n \n  Classroom - based or School - based training coordinated study other the \nschool or center, with classroom and/or laboratory components.  \n \n  Dual Training System (DTS) / Dualized Training Program (DTP) which \ncontain both in - school and in - industry tr a ining or fieldwork components.  \n \n  Supervised Industry Training (S IT) or on - the - job training (OJT) is an \napproach in training designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the \ntrainee through actual experience in the workplace to acquire specific \ncompetenci es as prescribed in the training regulations. It is imperative that \nthe deployment of trainees in the workplace is adhered to training programs \nagreed by the institution and enterprise and status and progress of trainees \nare closely monitored by the traini ng institutions to prevent opportunity for \nwork exploitation.",
