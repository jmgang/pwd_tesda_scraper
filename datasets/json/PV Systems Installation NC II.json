The standard of \nperformance required must be appropriate to industry and occupational \nneeds through the industry/enterprise or specified client group \nconsultations.  \n \nThese materials are available in both printed and electronic copies.  \n \nFor more information please contact:  \nTechnical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)  \nTelephone Nos.: 893 -8281, 817 -4076 to 82 loc. 611 to 630, 631 and 635 or \nvisit our website: www.tesda.gov.ph  \nor the TESDA Regional or Provincial Office nearest you.",
