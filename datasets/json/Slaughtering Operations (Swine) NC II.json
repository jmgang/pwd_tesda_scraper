The delivery of training shall adhere to the design of the curriculum. Delivery  \n  shall be guided by the principles of competency -based TVET.  \n \na. Course design is based on competency standards set by the industry or \nrecognized industry sector; (Learning system is driven by competencies written to \nindustry standards)  \n \nb. Training delivery is learner -centered and should accommodate individualized and \nself-paced learning strategies;  \n \nc. Training can be done on an actual workplace setting, simulation of a workplace \nand/or through adoption of modern technology.  \n \nd. Assessment is based in the collection of evidence of the performance of work to \nthe industry required standards;  \n \ne. Assessment of competency takes the trainee’s knowledge and attitude into \naccount but requires evidence of actual performance of the competency as the \nprimary source of evidence.  \n \nf. Training program allows for recognition of prior learning (RPL) or current \ncompetencies;  \n \ng. Training completion is based on satisfactory performance of all specified \ncompetencies.   \n \n2. The competency -based TVET system recognizes various types of delivery modes, \nboth on -and off -the-job as long as the learning is driven by the competency \nstandards specified by the industry.  The following training modalities and their \nvariations/components may be adopted singly or in combination with other \nmodalities when designing and delivering training programs:  \n \n2.1. Institution - Based:  \n \n• The traditional classroom -based or in -center instruction may be enhanced \nthrough use of learner -centered methods as well as laboratory or field -work \ncomponents.  \n \n3.3 TRAINEE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nTrainees or students who wish to enter this training should possess the following \nrequirements:  \n \n• Must have  completed 10 - years basic education  \n• Can communicate both oral ly and in writing",
