The following training modalities may be adopted when \ndesigning training programs:  \n \n  The dualized mode of training delivery is preferred and recommended. \nThus programs wou ld contain both in - school and in - industry training or \nfieldwork components. Details can be referred to the Dual Training System \n(DTS) Implementing Rules and Regulations.  \n \n  Modular/self - paced learning is a competency - based training modality \nwherein the train ee is allowed to progress at his own pace. The trainer just \nfacilitates the training delivery  \n.  \n  Peer teaching/mentoring is a training modality wherein fast learners are \ngiven the opportunity to assist the slow learners.  \n \n  Supervised industry training or on - the - job training is an approach in training \ndesigned to enhance the knowledge and skills of the trainee through actual \nexperience in the workplace to acquire specific competencies prescribed in \nthe training regulations.  \n \n  Distance learning is a formal educa tion process in which majority of the \ninstruction occurs when the students and instructor are not in the same \nplace. Distance learning may employ correspondence study, audio, video \nor computer technologies.",
